Soil moisture refers to the amount of water present in the soil. It is a critical factor in plant growth, crop production, and soil health. The amount of soil moisture varies depending on several factors, including rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind, soil type, vegetation cover, and topography. The moisture content in the soil is crucial for the germination of seeds, nutrient uptake, and plant growth. There are several methods for measuring soil moisture, including gravimetric analysis, neutron probes, time-domain reflectometry, and capacitance sensors. 

However, these methods are often time-consuming, expensive, and not suitable for large-scale applications.
Soil moisture is affected by a variety of factors including precipitation, temperature, soil type, topography, vegetation, and land use. Precipitation and temperature play a significant role in soil moisture levels, with areas receiving more rainfall typically having higher moisture levels. 

Soil type and topography also impact soil moisture, with clay soils holding more moisture than sandy soils and flat terrain experiencing more water pooling. Vegetation can help retain moisture or compete for water, and human activities such as agriculture, urbanization, and deforestation can also impact soil moisture. Overall, soil moisture is a complex interaction of several factors and has significant impacts on plant growth, water availability, and ecosystem health.

MoistureMinds.ipynb contains all the tested models and their accuracy scores.

#About_the_project
This repository contains the code and results for predicting soil moisture content using machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we have used two algorithms, namely multivariate linear regression and multivariate polynomial regression, to predict the soil moisture content. The results of our predictions for the period of March 1 to March 10 can be found on our website.

# Website
React based single page website consists of information and some of the functionalities of the models. for any given input date from march 1 to 10, predicted value for soil moisture level will be displayed. It will also ssuggest the best crops that could be grown in that level of soil moisture.
